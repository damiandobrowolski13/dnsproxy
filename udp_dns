# <!-- Part 1: UDP DNS Proxy (70%)
# Implement a UDP DNS proxy that listens on 127.0.0.1:1053 (a non-privileged port), forwards DNS queries to an upstream resolver (default 8.8.8.8), and relays responses. No caching is required.

# Requirements:

# Use only Python standard libraries (socket, select/asyncio, etc.).
# Handle multiple concurrent clients (e.g., non-blocking I/O).
# Preserve DNS transaction IDs and payloads (no parsing required).
# Implement basic timeouts and retries to the upstream server.
# Bind only to 127.0.0.1 (do not expose publicly).
# Log query names/types and response sizes.
# Testing: Use dig (preferred) to query your proxy:

# dig @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 example.com A
 

# Deliverables:

# part1.py
# README.txt with names/NetIDs, how to run, and a brief design description -->
